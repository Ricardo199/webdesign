    <h1>Green Day</h1>
    <p>
        Green Day is an American rock band formed in the East Bay of California in 1987 by lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong,<br>
        together with bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt. For most of the band's career they have been a power trio with drummer Tré Cool,<br> 
        who replaced John Kiffmeyer in 1990 before the recording of the band's second studio album, Kerplunk (1991). Before taking its current name in 1989,<br>
        Green Day was called Blood Rage, then Sweet Children.<br>
        <br>They were part of the late 1980s/early 1990s Bay Area punk scene that emerged from the 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California.<br> 
        The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records.<br> 
        <br>In 1994, their major-label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records,<br> 
        became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S.<br> 
        <br>Alongside fellow California punk bands Bad Religion, the Offspring, Rancid, NOFX, Pennywise and Social Distortion, 
        <br>Green Day is credited with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.

        <dt>Jesus of Suburbia</dt>
            <dd>An edgy story about a guy, very punk, very hard,<br>
                it's a concept album, meaning that it tells a story in the lyrics and each song continues the story from the previous song</dd>
        <dt>American Idiot</dt>
            <dd>The album tackles various issues the band sees in the american public and America as a country,<br>
                each song has a unique sound reflecting the topic the song is tackling, very punk rock and sometimes very chill</dd>
